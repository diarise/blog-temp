## **Stepping Into the Park**

Walking through the entrance of Universal Studios Hollywood always brings a familiar rush of excitement. We visit often, so it has become a place where new memories blend with favorite traditions. The famous globe fountain at the front is our usual photo stop, and the energy of the park hits the moment you walk through the gates. The entry process was smooth, and once inside, we knew exactly where to go first, so we headed straight into the fun.

Before entering the park, it’s worth mentioning that General Parking currently costs $35 before 5 p.m., Preferred Parking is $60, and Front Gate Parking is $80. Arriving early not only gives you better parking options but also helps you make the most of your day inside the park.

## **Upper Lot: Magic at the Top**

Our first stop was the Upper Lot, where the atmosphere feels like a blend of Hollywood movie sets and theme park energy. This area is packed with family-friendly attractions, shows, and themed areas.

We began at the DreamWorks Theatre featuring **Kung Fu Panda**, which had the shortest wait time of the day and was a multi-sensory adventure that the whole family enjoyed. From there, we wandered into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Walking through Hogsmeade and entering Hogwarts Castle never gets old. Riding Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey made us feel like we were flying alongside Harry and his friends, and we couldn’t leave without trying a cold butterbeer.

Nearby, Springfield offered plenty of laughs and photos. The kids devoured a giant pink donut as we explored Krusty Burger and Lard Lad Donuts. Although The Simpsons Ride was temporarily closed during our visit, the area itself is a lively and fun experience, and the ride is a must for families. 

For family-focused fun, **Despicable Me Minion Mayhem** was a hit. This 3D motion simulator lets people join the Minions on their hilarious adventures andand prepared to be **minionized**. 

**Secret Life of Pets: Off the Leash!** is another interactive attraction with animatronics and screens, providing an engaging and playful experience for younger visitors.

## **Lower Lot: Thrills and Interactive Worlds**

The Lower Lot is where thrill rides dominate, but it also includes immersive interactive zones and family-friendly fun. The escalator ride down, known as the StarWay, provides stunning views of the San Fernando Valley.

We started with **Jurassic World – The Ride**, a high-energy water and animatronic adventure. Even though I clutched my daughter for the big drop, it ended up being my favorite ride. We refueled at the Jurassic Café before heading to **Transformers: The Ride 3D**, an action-packed motion-based ride that immerses guests in the battle between Autobots and Decepticons. While exciting, it’s also accessible to families who want thrills.

**Revenge of the Mummy – The Ride** is an indoor coaster with twists, darkness, and surprises, while **Super Nintendo World** is Universal’s newest and most immersive land. By the time we checked the app, the earliest entry was 6 p.m., so we waited about two and a half hours. The immersive rooms, glowing crystal effects, and Bowser’s Castle-inspired design made the wait worthwhile. 

For younger kids, **Super Silly Fun Land** is perfect. It features water play areas, interactive games, and the **Silly Swirly Ride**, a gentle spinning ride ideal for little ones. It’s a safe, fun, and shaded place where children can enjoy themselves while parents take a moment to relax.

## **Studio Tour: Behind the Scenes**

No Universal visit is complete without the Studio Tour. The hour-long tram ride takes you behind real movie sets, including the Bates Motel from *Psycho* and Jupiter’s Claim from *Nope*. We experienced King Kong in 3D, simulated floods, earthquakes, and even a high-speed car chase with the *Fast & Furious* cast. Doing this earlier in the day is ideal to avoid the afternoon heat.

## **Character Meet & Greets**

One of the most memorable parts of a Universal Studios Hollywood visit is the character meet and greets. These encounters happen all day throughout the park and add so much personality to the experience. On the Upper Lot, it’s common to run into the Minions, the Simpsons family, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy, King Julien from *Madagascar*, and several DreamWorks favorites like Queen Poppy from *Trolls* and characters from *Gabby’s Dollhouse*. Donkey, from *Shrek*, is a fan favorite thanks to his hilarious and quick-witted banter with park guests—his interactive personality always draws a crowd. When I visited in September, Hello Kitty was also out greeting guests, which was a fun surprise and a hit with both kids and adults.

Down on the Lower Lot, you’ll find Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and Megatron from *Transformers*, who are known for their impressive costumes and in-character interactions. Blue, the raptor from *Jurassic World*, is also there for meet and greets, giving guests a chance to get up close (almost too close) to one of the park’s most lifelike creatures. Over at Super Nintendo World, Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach are usually stationed near the entrance, ready for photos and waves.

These character moments are scattered throughout the day, so you don’t need to stick to a strict schedule to catch them. It’s easy to stumble upon your favorite character as you explore, and the interactions—especially for kids—create some of the most fun and spontaneous memories of the day. For those who like to plan ahead, **downloading the official Universal Studios Hollywood app is a game-changer**. The app shows character locations and appearance times, along with show schedules, so you can plan meet and greets more efficiently and avoid missing your favorites.

## **Dining and What’s New**

Universal’s dining scene has grown significantly. In addition to classics like **Three Broomsticks** and Springfield’s Krusty Burger, new spots include **Power Up Café** outside Super Nintendo World, offering quick themed snacks. **Raising Cane’s** is under construction at CityWalk, replacing Dongpo Kitchen, and **Slice House by Tony Gemignani** is expected in summer 2025. Fans of desserts can visit **Hello Kitty & Friends Café** or **Toothsome Chocolate Emporium & Savory Feast Kitchen** for full meals and creative treats.

The **Toadstool Café** inside Super Nintendo World remains a popular choice, but reservations through the app are recommended to avoid long lines.

## **Family Tips: Passes, Strollers & Rider Switch**

**Express Pass or Not?**

One of the biggest questions families have when planning a trip to Universal Studios Hollywood is whether the **Universal Express Pass** is worth it. This pass gives you **one-time express access to each ride, attraction, and seated show**, helping you skip most of the regular lines. On busy weekends or during peak seasons, it can be a game-changer — especially with kids who don’t enjoy waiting in long lines. If you’re visiting on a weekday during off-peak times, you may not need it for every ride, but it’s still a great option if you want to cover a lot in one day without feeling rushed.

**Stroller-Friendly Tips**

If you’re visiting with younger kids, bringing or renting a **stroller** is highly recommended. Universal Studios Hollywood involves **a lot of walking and hills**, especially when moving between the Upper and Lower Lots. There are designated stroller parking areas near most attractions, and the walkways are wide enough to navigate comfortably. A stroller also gives little ones a place to rest during the day, which can be a lifesaver by the afternoon. Just remember to label your stroller clearly, as many families park them in the same areas.

**Rider Switch for Parents**

Universal Studios Hollywood makes it easier for parents with little ones to still enjoy the thrill rides through their **Rider Switch** (also called Child Swap) program. If your child is too small or doesn’t want to ride, one parent can stay behind with the child while the other rides. When the first parent returns, the second parent can ride **without having to wait in the regular line all over again**. Each attraction has a designated Rider Switch area, usually near the loading zone. This system is a huge time-saver and allows both parents to experience the rides while keeping the day smooth for everyone — especially families with toddlers or younger kids.

## **What’s Coming Next**

Universal is expanding with new attractions and dining options. **Fast & Furious: Hollywood Drift**, a high-speed spinning coaster, is expected to open in 2026, replacing the older *Fast & Furious: Supercharged* ride. New restaurants and cafes at CityWalk continue to improve convenience and variety for families and visitors.
